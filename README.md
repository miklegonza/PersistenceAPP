# Persistence APP for Android

This is a little Android application that consumes a web service with Volley.

It has only a simple main activity with 3 text fields and 4 buttons (CRUD)

## Running

You need to have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) in order to build and run the project.

In the `MainActivity` class you have to change the baseURL where the API is located.

## API

You can find the API [here](https://github.com/miklegonza/PersistenceAPI)
